Welcome! As a molecular microbial ecologist and a biogeochemist, I study how microbial communities
interact and co-evolve with the earthâ€™s biogeochemical cycles, particularly under global change scenarios.

Currently, I am a [Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://geosciences.princeton.edu/people/linta-reji#:-:text=linta%20reji) in the department of Geosciences at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. from the department of [Earth System Sciences](https://earthsystemscience.stanford.edu/) at the [Doerr School of Sustainability](
https://sustainability.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.


### In July 2024, I will start an independent research group in the *[Department of Geophysical Sciences](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/linta-reji/) at the University of Chicago*. 
**Opportunities are available at all levels to join the group (graduate students, postdocs, and research technicians). [Contact](mailto:lreji@princeton.edu) to find out more!**
